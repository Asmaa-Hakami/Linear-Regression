# Linear-Regression
Predict medical insurance cost using Linear Regression  algorithm.

Steps:
1. Load the dataset from CSV file. 
2.	Divide the dataset into training and testing (use splitting ratio 80:20). 
3.	Impute any missing value and convert categorical values to numerical.
4.	Train a linear regression model using a gradient descent algorithm with a mean square error (MSE) cost-function, learning rate Î±=0.01, and stopping condition number of iterations=10. 
5.	Keep a record of the cost at each iteration and plot the cost at each iteration against iterations.
6.	Test the performance of the model by computing and reporting the MSE on the testing set. 
7.	Find and report the most significant features in the regression model.
